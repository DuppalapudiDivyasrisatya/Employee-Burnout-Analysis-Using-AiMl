# Employee-Burnout-Analysis-Using-AiMl
Employee burnout is a critical issue faced by organizations worldwide, leading to decreased productivity, higher turnover rates, and negative workplace morale. This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyze and predict employee burnout by identifying key factors contributing to it. 
The goal is to assist organizations in proactively addressing burnout and creating a healthier work environment.
